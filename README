# The represitory will be about scripts (and maybe in the long run, a single program through which different scripts 
# can be called) to clean messed up files into files which can be worked with through importing it into MS Excel or MS 
# Access (or any other relevant software). The code is a bit messy right now and probably not optimised since I'm not
# so experienced in the code yet. That said, I'm open to suggestions for optimising the code and learning about new ways
# of doing the same thing, better and faster :)
